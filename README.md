# Newborn-Health-Prediction
This project aims to develop an intelligent system that predicts the health condition of newborn babies based on medical and physiological parameters. The goal is to assist healthcare professionals in identifying potential health risks at an early stage and improve neonatal care outcomes.

### Objective
To analyze newborn health data and identify factors influencing health outcomes.

To build a predictive machine learning model that classifies the health status of a newborn as Healthy or At Risk.

To provide an interpretable model that can support early diagnosis and intervention.
